# Medical_Data_History_Project


📌 Overview

The Medical Data History project focuses on extracting meaningful clinical and operational insights from simulated hospital datasets using SQL analytics and Power BI dashboards. The analysis includes patient demographics, diagnoses, admissions, doctor specialties, and regional healthcare patterns—offering a full view of hospital operations through the lens of data.


🎯 Objectives

Analyze structured medical records to discover trends and operational gaps.

Highlight geographic and specialty-based healthcare needs.

Identify chronic conditions and recurring patient behaviors.

Improve healthcare resource planning through data insights.

Leverage SQL and Power BI to generate actionable intelligence.


🔍 Key Insights

🧬 1. Patient Demographics
Male patients (55%) slightly outnumber females (45%).

Most common birth decades: 1980s and 1990s—indicating a young adult majority among patients.

🌆 2. Geographic Distribution
Some cities are heavily burdened with patients, especially those with chronic conditions.

Insight: These areas require more clinics, outreach, and chronic care facilities.

⚠️ 3. Allergy & Risk Factors
Common allergies include Penicillin, Sulfa drugs, Codeine.

NULL allergy values were replaced with “NKA” (No Known Allergies).

Recommendation: Enhance allergy documentation for improved safety.

⚖️ 4. Obesity Trends
~18% of patients classified as obese using BMI calculations.

Suggests a critical need for preventive care and health awareness programs.

🏥 5. Admission Behavior
Same-day admissions are common.

Highest traffic on Day 15 and Day 22 of the month.

Insight: Useful for scheduling, staffing, and resource planning.

❤️ 6. Diagnosis Patterns
Congestive Heart Failure leads in repeat hospital visits.

Other top diagnoses: Pneumonia, Pregnancy, Appendicitis, Myocardial Infarction.

🩺 7. Doctor Specialty Distribution
General Physicians and Internal Medicine dominate.

Shortage of Neurologists and Psychiatrists, highlighting gaps in mental and neurological care.

🔗 8. Doctor–Patient Matching
Dr. Lisa Joins treats multiple Epilepsy patients (example from query-level drilldown).

Supports role-based care optimization and outcome tracking.

🔐 9. Security Features
Temporary patient passwords generated using a logic-based formula combining ID, name length, and birth year.

Demonstrates real-world application of secure, dynamic patient access systems.


🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Realistic Simulation of hospital operations using multi-table databases.

✅ Performed 35+ optimized SQL queries across diverse analytical angles.

✅ Delivers comprehensive insights ranging from demographics to diagnosis trends.

✅ Blends clinical, operational, and security-focused analytics.

✅ Power BI dashboards bring interactivity and clarity to insights.


📝 Project Highlights

Analyzed structured hospital data: patients, doctors, diagnoses, admissions.

Executed complex SQL queries including JOINs, filters, subqueries, and CASE logic.

Developed a secure system for patient document access via dynamic temp passwords.

Identified gaps in healthcare service delivery based on diagnosis and location.

Recommended targeted health interventions and operational reforms.


🧠 Business & Healthcare Value

📌 Resource Allocation: Optimize clinics, staff, and specialties where patient load is high.

📌 Chronic Care Focus: Address repeat diagnoses (e.g., heart failure) with better follow-up systems.

📌 Public Health Strategy: Use obesity and allergy data to guide preventive campaigns.

📌 Technology Integration: Secure systems (like temp passwords) simulate real EHR applications.


📈 Recommendations

Improve allergy and risk documentation in EHR systems.

Use diagnosis frequency to invest in chronic care programs.

Deploy obesity-reduction campaigns in high-risk zones.

Realign doctor specialties to meet demand, especially in neurology and mental health.

Expand dashboard usage among healthcare decision-makers for data-driven planning.


✅ Conclusion

This project presents a robust framework for analyzing healthcare data using SQL, translating technical output into practical insights. It not only uncovers operational gaps but also highlights how technology and analytics can shape smarter health systems. With a focus on clinical relevance, demographic analysis, and hospital behavior patterns, this study supports strategic decisions that improve patient care, resource efficiency, and public health outcomes.
